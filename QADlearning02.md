##### standard costs
* A standard cost for a product consists of a price standard (price for material; rate for labor and manufacturing burden) and a quantity standard ().
* 一个产品的 标准成本(standard cost) = price standard + quantity standard
* price standard = 材料(**material**)的价格 + rate for **labor** + manufacturing **burden**
* quantity standard =  quantity for material + time for labor + quantity/volume for manufacturing burden

* The combination of price and quantity yields what is planned or expected for a specific interval of time and set of conditions.

* Cost for Overhead and Sub-Contract costs are set up and included in the Inventory value.

* Setting standards for price and quantity involves management judgements, industrial engineering studies, work measurement studies, vendor analyses, as well as a number of other techniques
Once set, the standard cost of an item is used as the basis for all accounting entries for inventory related transactions. 

* Standard costs cover a specific period, usually a year. They can evaluated and changed at any time.



##### Recoverable taxes & non-recoverable taxes
* recoverable taxes: 可扣税
	* A tax paid on purchases that is offset against tax collected on sales. 
	* 在采购(buy)时交的税(需交给卖方的)，可以抵消我本身销售时所征的税(我是零售商,向客户收的税)。
	* 这种税额可在GL(总账)中被追踪。For Global Tax Management, they update the AP(account payable,供应商) Tax account for the tax rate(税率). 
	* For recoverable taxes, the tax point(起税日期) is normally invoice receipt. 

* non-recoverable taxes: 非可扣税

	 	Taxes: Recoverable vs. Non-Recoverable


		You very likely collect sales taxes from your customers, and then remit the money you collected to the government tax authorities. 
		You also very likely pay taxes on items you buy for your business, or services you hire for your businesses. 
		A tax is recoverable if you can deduct the tax that you've paid from the tax that you have collected. 
		A tax is non-recoverable if you have to remit the full amount you've collected regardless of what you may have paid (in the same tax). 
		 
		Example 1: Recoverable Taxes
		Let's imagine a customer, Jane, who sells widgets. In the state where Jane does business, there's a sales tax called Unpleasant Tax 1 (UT1). The tax rate is 5%. UT1 is recoverable.
		When Jane sells $100 of widgets, she charges 5% UT1. In other words, she collects $5 in UT1.
		When Jane buys paper for the office printer for $20, she pays 5% UT1, which works out to $1.
		Since UT1 is  recoverable, when it comes time to remit the tax she's collected to the government, Jane subtracts the tax paid ($1) from the tax collected ($5), and sends the government $4.  
		总共交了$5 
		 
		 
		Example 2: Non-Recoverable Taxes
		Let's imagine another customer, Paula, who sells gaskets. In the state where Paula does business, there's a sales tax called Unpleasant Tax 2 (UT2). The tax rate is 5%. UT2 is non-recoverable.
		When Paula sells $100 of gaskets, she charges 5% UT2. In other words, she collects $5 in UT2. 
		When Paula buys paper for the office printer for $20, she pays 5% UT2, which works out to $1. 
		Since UT2 is non-recoverable, when it comes time to remit the tax she's collected to the government, Paula ignores the tax that she has paid, and sends the government all the money she collected, in other words the full $5. 
		总共交了$6



##### Variances
* Three kinds of variance occur during the purchasing or accounts payable cycle
	* purchase price variance (standard costing only).PPV
		> Purchase price variance occurs when the PO cost for an inventory item does not match its GL cost. This variance does not occur for memo items, which have no standard cost.
		
	* AP usage variance.APV
		> AP usage variance occurs when the invoice quantity for an item does not match its PO quantity and you close the receiver line in the supplier invoice
		
	* AP rate variance.APV
		> AP rate variance occurs when the invoice cost for an item does not match its PO cost.



##### PPV (Purchase Price Variance) 采购价格差异
* The difference between unit cost on a purchase order and GL unit cost in an item master.
* Calculated when a purchase order is received.
* 计算公式{PO Unit Cost – (GL Unit Cost – Overhead)} * PO Qty Received

##### APV (Accounts Payable Variance) 
* The difference between invoice price and purchase order cost. Calculated when the supplier invoice is matched with receivers in accounts payable.


##### Unit Cost


##### 增值税（value added tax，VAT）
* 增值税是一种**销售税**，属累退税，是基于商品或服务的增值而征税的一种间接税，在澳大利亚、加拿大、新西兰、新加坡称为商品及服务税(Goods and Services Tax, GST)，在日本称作消费税
